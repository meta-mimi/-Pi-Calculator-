# -Pi-Calculator-
The most inefficient way to calculate pi

Uses pygame, and calculates 1-99 digits of pi (if you have the time).

Menu is just a prompt, quit button, and text input box. The input box only takes up to two numbers, enter is the start button.

The "game" is more of a movie, with the menu button at the top resetting everything.


This program is based on a 3blue1brown video that talks about calculating pi with perfectly elastic no friction collisions! Thanks to him for the idea.
